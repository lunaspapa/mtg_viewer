# MTG Card Viewer

## Purpose

I wanted to create something that challenged me to use React and CSS to create an interactive card viewing experience.
The program doesn't serve any technical purpose but it is a fun thing I wanted to create.

## Features

### Pasting Cards

I wanted the app to be able to paste entire decklists or even just lists of cards in a variety of different import formats
that MTG players use.

### Backside // Modal

The app features cards that will be flippable to their back side or their modal side.

### Interactive Viewing

The app also features an interactive card viewing experience, where cards are blown up and can move with the mouse and produce a
subtle lighting effect.
